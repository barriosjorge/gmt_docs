<span id="id1"></span><h1>2.2.2. <em>General Requirements</em><a class="headerlink" href="#general-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>General Requirements involve: SWCS common standards, environmental and health,
general services, maintenance, documentation, and testing – items which are
required to establish and maintain the baseline health and proper functioning
the observatory at all times that GMTO is in operation. The items are briefly
summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>Standards Requiremnets</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Standards Requirements involve SWCS standards that enable the integration of
software and hardware into a coherent telescope system, whereas data formats
standards establish common practices for properly expressing and representing
numerical and science data.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><em>SWCS standards</em> -– The SWCS standards require that the SWCS establish a
reference model for a control subsystem, software and hardware standards
(SWC-REF-00029) and comply with electronic, software (operating systems,
user interface libraries, distributed system libraries, network,
databases, etc.), and hardware standards (control computers, PLCs,
workstations, servers, I/O modules, fieldbuses and network).</li>
<li><em>Data Formats</em> -– Data format standards require that the SWCS use SI units,
that all numerical values which represent physical magnitudes have units,
that GMT adopt the Flexible Image Transport Systems (FITS) to record
science observations, that the GMT data be compliant with Virtual
Observatory standards, and that the SWCS provide a data archive system for
collecting, storing, and retrieving all raw data and metadata acquired
during observations for the lifetime of the observatory.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Health and Safety Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>To establish a safe working environment, the GMT project adopts industry
standards presented in the document: GMT Compliance to Regulations, Codes and
Standards <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#sawy12a" id="id2">[Sawy12a]</a>, which the SWCS inheritsa nd complies with as the
baseline.  The Hazard Analysis process described in Chapter 5.11 of the SLPDR
identifies safety risks and defines mitigation actions that are allocated to
GMT subsystems, including the SWCS. The SWCS is required to provide
capabilities: to continuously monitor performance, status, and health of the
system; to interface with the Interlock and Safety System; to enhance the
safety and integrity of the system with software; to include redundant safety
limits on moving parts that have risk implications for the hardware or
personnel; and to enable manual interlock override without interference from
software. However the SWCS is not ultimately responsible for the safety of the
personnel and the system. The SWCS must also inherit operating limits
established by Level 2 requirements, such as observing limits for science
observations that include absolute hardware and software limit-switches. In
case of central control failure (e.g., in the observatory control system,
operator console), all critical subsystems will have built-in time-outs.
Lastly, the SWCS will provide status information for: common operating states,
alarm conditions, trip conditions and corrective actions, power supply, and
other items required to operate subsystems from the control room.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Environmental Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Environmental requirements facilitate the optimal use of the observatory by
monitoring the atmosphere and weather forecasts to aid observation scheduling,
planning, and on-the-fly decision making. The requirements protect the
observatory and instruments actively during adverse weather (lightning, rain,
and wind storms) and earthquakes by triggering emergency procedures
automatically or with operator supervision. The electronic and hardware
components must also be protected passively from moisture, power surges, wind,
etc.</p>
<p>The Environmental Requirements stipulate that the GMT will be operated
centrally from a control room, and that electronic equipment for operating the
telescope, AO, and instruments will be located in the electronics room. The
SWCS will provide capabilities: to access weather forecasting; to interface to
the environment monitoring facility to monitor dust, atmospheric turbulence,
water vapor, atmospheric seeing, weather conditions; and to record, and make
accessible, all environmental statistics. In the event of an earthquake, the
SWCS is designed to survive without structure failure up to a maximum level
defined in the document on GMT Environmental Conditions <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#mait12" id="id3">[Mait12]</a>. The SWCS
will provide capability to execute automated safety procedures to protect
personnel, the telescope, enclosure, instruments, and electrical systems, in
the event of loss of power, storms, lightning, and earthquakes.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Services Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Service requirements involve power, electrical grounding, liquid cooling,
compressed air, nitrogen, helium, communication lines, electronic cabinets, and
washing services. GMTO will utilize Chilean standard voltages (380V 3-phase and
220V single phase) and frequency (50 Hz), backed up by on-site emergency power
generators, and supplied to the telescope through various power distribution
panels and electronics cabinets installed as part of the telescope systems
utilities infrastructure. The SWCS hardware (e.g., computers, networking
equipment) will run off of UPS as per the GMT Common Utilities power budget
(GMT-SE-REF-00366).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><em>Power</em> -– The requirements for the electrical power systems are defined in
GMT Electrical Power Systems <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#sawy12b" id="id4">[Sawy12b]</a> and Telescope Common Utilities and
Equipment <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#sawy12c" id="id5">[Sawy12c]</a>.  The SWCS is required to provide cabling
infrastructure to support safe installation and operation of the GMT control
system.</li>
<li><em>Grounds</em> -– In addition to the grounds associated with power feeds to various
sub-circuits and equipment on the telescope, additional circuits will be
required to electrically ground the structures of the moving components
(azimuth disk, Optical Support Structure, and GIR), and other locations to
isolate noise sensitive equipment. The SWCS equipment will be compatible
with the GMT power filtering and grounding system, which has been designed
to minimize electrical interference.</li>
<li><em>Electronics Cabinets</em> -– According to the document Telescope Common
Utilities and Equipment8, there are 8 service bays on the GIR that will be
used for placing 16 electronics cabinets. The IP platform and azimuth
platform structures will also include an area for locating electronic
cabinets. The Standard Electronics Cabinets (SEC) includes active heat
removal for a maximum of 2000 W, and feature remote power on/off control.
Each SEC provides 2200W of 220V UPS. The SEC maintains the air inside the
cabinet to an average temperature of ambient ± 2C. The SWCS hardware
components will be designed to allow adequate installation clearances inside
the SEC and will provide the local control of the cabinets and the
integration with the supervisory components of the Observatory Control
System for global start-stop sequences and health monitoring.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Reliability and Maintainability Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>These requirements promote system reliability and facilitate routine
maintenance. Reliability is achieved by: using high quality components,
over-specifying or overrating equipment, implementing contamination control,
using proven design techniques, designing for ease of serviceability, and
providing adequate spare parts. The SWCS will provide: an engineering mode to
allow low-level control of components and subsystems; software tools to
display real-time and long-term performance trends of components and
subsystems; an ability to correlate time-stamped data with other subsystems.
The SWCS will also provide equipment, procedures, and safe access, to maintain
and service all critical components. The SWCS will provide the capability to
achieve maintenance time requirements per Maintenance Time Budget
(GMT-SE-DOC-00420). The SWCS will also standardize common components to
optimize the stock and number of different spare parts.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Documentation Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>The SWCS will provide documentation needed to operate, support, and maintain
the GMT. All SWCS documentation will be accessible, searchable, and
retrievable on-line. SWCS documentation will also provide access to user
guides for all equipment and facility instrumentation used during routine
operations, technical documentation (manuals, drawings), and electronics
schematics.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Testing Requirements</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>Testing requirements pertain to testing and verification of the GMT software,
instruments, and subsystems produced by all the partners and subcontractors
working with and for the project. The SWCS will develop software modules that
have automated test procedures, and that support testing for backward
compatibility. Contractors and procurement suppliers must provide SWCS all
necessary software and hardware tools for factory acceptance testing.
Documentation for testing includes information on the version of equipment,
version of test specification, and version of design specification, for every
test (unit testing, system and integration, acceptance). The SWCS will
generate a report that tracks all requirements that are fulfilled,
unfulfilled, or unverifiable, using a common template. All the software
components of the SWCS will be subject to a Continuous Integration Process
with the goal of ensuring interface compatibility before the final
integration. The Continuous Integration Process will also include automated
unit and integration testing as the software modules are incrementally
developed. This process will include all the software components, regardless
of the organization procuring them.</div></blockquote>

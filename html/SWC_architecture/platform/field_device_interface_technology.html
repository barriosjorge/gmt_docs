<span id="field-device-interface"></span><h1>8.2. Field Device Interface Technology<a class="headerlink" href="#field-device-interface-technology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Industrial fieldbuses have in the last few years moved from serial based
protocols like CAN or Profibus to Ethernet-based protocols. Ethernet-based
protocols are a successor of the VME backplanes used in previous generation
telescopes and have become one of the most common ways to connect input/output
modules with control processors, especially in industrial automation. These
protocols are based on industrial standards, which tend to be long-lived and
very stable, making them an ideal choice for the time span of the GMT project.
Among the different alternatives, EtherCAT is the most attractive: in addition
to being an ISO/IEC standard, several implementations of its components (e.g.,
master and slave stacks) are available on many platforms, including open source
alternatives.</p>
<p>EtherCAT is used to connect hardware devices (e.g., sensors and actuators) to
the fieldbus via Input/Output modules (IOModules). These modules implement
device profile standards based on the CAN Open specifications, for example the
CiA 402: CANopen device profile for drives and motion control (internationally
standardized in IEC 61800-7-201 and IEC 61800-7-301). In this way, the interface
protocol with local controllers is defined by standard profiles, often available
as XML files, thereby guaranteeing the availability of components from different
vendors. Interfaces based on industrial protocols reduce the systems engineering
burden and greatly facilitate the definition of control interfaces.</p>
<p>The field interface technology is greatly influenced by industrial automation
devices, which are becoming increasingly smart, as low-level motion controllers
are embedded directly in the field devices, reducing the need for separate
external control loops. With many control loops closed locally at the drives
level, the control computers in the electronic cabinets can be drastically
reduced in size and in many cases might not be needed at all.</p>
<p>The SWCS field device interface requirement is given by ELS-8030, Field Bus
Standard: The standard field bus shall be EtherCAT.</p>
<div class="section" id="ethercat">
<h2>8.2.1. <em>EtherCAT</em><a class="headerlink" href="#ethercat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The GMT standard Ethernet fieldbus is <a class="reference external" href="http://ethercat.org/en/ethercat.html">EtherCAT</a>, which is used to connect field
devices to DCCs (both PCs and PLCs) through IOModules. In general, all the
deployment cases can be grouped in:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>DCCs connected to field devices via slave IOModules. This case is the most
common and is supported by a variety of different vendors. A very frequent
instance is, for example, Digital/Analog EtherCAT modules and motor drivers
– also called smart drives – which from a logical perspective are considered
IOModules, too.</li>
<li>DCCs connected to field devices directly. In this case the slave field
device has a fieldbus interface built in, for example, in the case of
EtherCAT encoders.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Fieldbus cabling between DCCs and the first bus coupler is Ethernet. The
connection between the first bus coupler installed in the electronics room and
the rest of the bus couplers in the bus is optical fiber. This is done via an
optical fiber trunk cable to a distribution panel in a control cabinet inside
the telescope chamber. The control cabinets are located in strategic places of
the telescope structure. Inside the cabinet the field bus cable is converted
from fiber to copper. The cabling between the control cabinet and the device
power cabinets is done using CAT5e/CAT6 industrial Ethernet cables that are
robust, cost effective, and provide a reliable connection technology. The
IOModules are connected to DCCs using a cable redundancy arrangement. The
status of DC power supplies and their corresponding protections are monitored,
and potential free contacts are provided for the wiring in the GMT Power
cabinets.  The master fieldbus DCC uses the IgH EtherCAT master in order to
communicate with the IOModules connected to the fieldbus.</p>
<p>GMT has performed extensive testing connecting EtherCAT remote IOModules and
motion drives with real-time computers via fiber optics <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#bec12c" id="id2">[Bec12c]</a>. The tests,
using cycle times between 0.1 and 0.5 milliseconds (time to read inputs,
process them and write outputs from the real time computer), have shown a
remarkable stability. This solution makes it possible to locate the control
computers in the electronics room instead of the telescope structure. The
consequences of this arrangement are: less heat dissipation, space and mass
required in the telescope enclosure, major cost reduction, and easier
maintenance. The Figure below shows an example of how GMT will deploy the DCC,
IOModules and field devices for the case of the Acquisition and Guiding
Wavefront Sensor System.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id4">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 8.4 </span><span class="caption-text">EtherCAT topology sample for the Acquisition and Guiding Wavefront Sensor System.</span></p>
</div>
<p>GMT will adopt the CiA 402 CANopen device profile for drives and motion control,
which is suitable for frequency inverters, servo controllers, and stepper
motors. It is internationally standardized in IEC 61800-7-163 and IEC
61800-7-20164. The fact that the CiA402 profile type directly maps to EtherCAT
network technology in the IEC 61800-7-30165 standard speaks to the robustness
and long term stability of EtherCAT technology.</p>

<div class="section" id="electronic-cabinets">
<h2>8.2.2. <em>Electronic Cabinets</em><a class="headerlink" href="#electronic-cabinets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>GMT has defined a Standard Electronics Cabinet (SEC) to be used by all
subsystems, to the extent possible, for the integration of their electronics.
The SEC includes a cooling system to maintain the air temperature inside the
cabinet near ambient and a power distribution unit for providing electrical
power to the subsystems. The SECs will be purchased, modified, and configured
by GMT and will be provided to the subsystem teams, as requested, for
integration and assembly of their electronics. Detailed specifications of the
SEC with drawings and envelopes, as well as wiring standards for GMT are
specified in the document GMT Electronics Standards <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#sawy13a" id="id3">[Sawy13a]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terminal-blocks">
<h2>8.2.3. <em>Terminal Blocks</em><a class="headerlink" href="#terminal-blocks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Terminal Block technology plays an important role in the GMT design. Robust
wiring connections are essential to ensuring reliable and stable communication
between field elements and the electronics. Among the many variants existing
in the market today, the Push-In Technology (PIT) is preferred. PIT allows
connections whereby solid conductors or conductors with ferrules directly
insert into the terminal block. Only a flat-head screwdriver is necessary to
insert the wire and, in many cases, requires no tools at all. With PIT’s latch
function there is no need for special tools; using the integrated actuation
lever one can release the connected conductors quickly and easily. Vibration,
shock, and corrosion resistances are all covered by industrial standards
compliance. A few other Terminal Block features that are highly useful are
double function shafts that allow plug- in bridges and openings for test point
contacts. See the figure below for a couple of examples on the PIT terminal
block technology with bridges and test points adopted by GMT.</p>

shafts on the main power terminal blocks.</p>

<h2>8.2.4. <em>Integrated Prototypes</em><a class="headerlink" href="#integrated-prototypes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Several integrated tests have been performed at GMT with lab-assembled
prototypes. This implementation is set up with Linux servers running the
EtherCAT master, IO terminals from different vendors, custom made slaves,
drives commanding different types of motors (AC and steppers) and several
field sensors, like RTDs, PT100s, and load cells. The Figure below (left)
shows the first control panel prototype receiving the EtherCAT communications
from the DCCs over fiber with bus couplers, IOModules and motor drives in a
daisy-chain topology. The right-hand-side also shows the second-generation
control prototype, adding an Industrial PC with local control of the
electrical power startup sequence and load cell measurements, all with a
bus/tree topology. The Figure below shows the current prototype, which
includes all of the previous features in an electronics panel housed by a
Rittal TS8 cabinet. This is the design that drove the concept of GMT standard
electronics cabinet (SEC). Short cycle times in the order of 100us have been
achieved successfully with this setup.</p>

<p>The life cycle of observing programs, <a class="reference internal" href="#observatory-workflow"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 33</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="#phase-1-2-activity-diagram"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 34</span></a>, typically begins with
astronomers, who prepare and submit telescope proposals to a Time Allocation
Committee (TAC) for review. In this first stage, astronomers access Observatory
Tools on-line to design their experiment, to format their proposal and to gauge
feasibility, which is contingent on exposure time calculations, guide star
availability, AO Strehl requirements, etc. The proposals sent to GMTO are stored
in the observatory program database, evaluated for technical correctness, and
distributed to the TAC for review. Afterwards, decisions by the TAC return to
the GMTO program database for processing and distribution back to the
astronomers. Highly ranked proposals are passed on from Phase I into Phase II
and stored into the operations database.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 33 </span><span class="caption-text">Top level Observatory Workflow</span></p>
</div>
<p>During Phase II of proposal preparations, data from Phase I (e.g., program
description, target coordinates, basic instrument configuration, exposure time,
scheduling constraints) become the starting point for observation planning.
Details of observing strategies, instrument configuration, guide star selection,
dither and mosaic pattern, etc., are entered into the system in a way that can
be directly recalled, interpreted, and executed by the telescope control system.
This process, illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#phase-1-2-activity-diagram"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 34</span></a>,
may iterate several (or numerous) times between an observer, the proposal
validation system, and a GMTO observatory scientist until the program can
satisfy technical, science, and scheduling constraints for implementation.
Before execution, all the details necessary to properly carry out observations
are stored permanently into the GMTO archival database to be recalled and
executed by an observer.</p>

</div>
<p>As specified by the Operation Concept Document (OCD), GMT will have several
operational modes: classical (on-site and remote), queue, and interrupt
observing. All operational modes require long-term program scheduling procedures
that optimize on parameters that are known a priori (moon phase, instrument
availability schedule, air mass requirements, science program ranking). However,
in queue mode, the different observing programs and targets get shuffled into
and out of the schedule, on-the-fly, to optimize the use of telescope resources
according to runtime conditions (e.g., weather, seeing, instrument behavior).
Programs that do not get observed, or are only partially observed, are returned
back into shorter-term, medium-term, or long-term queues. The Section on
<a class="reference internal" href="scheduling_system.html#scheduling-system"><span class="std std-ref">Scheduling System</span></a> describes the scheduling system in more detail.</p>
<p>During daytime, observers, AO and instrument specialists prepare appropriate
calibrations. Engineering activities (installation, configuration, calibrations,
and maintenance) also occurs in the morning to mid-afternoon, conducted by
observatory staff. For routine initialization and calibration procedures,
customizable software sequences will expedite the process and minimize
repetitive user involvement where feasible. Typically, observers or operators
perform basic data calibrations for science observations to remove instrumental
signatures, such as flatfielding, or for photometric or wavelength calibration,
etc. Instrument calibrations are performed both in the afternoon and often
throughout the night for AO, and some spectroscopic instruments that may involve
moving calibration sources into and out of the telescope optical path.
Pre-defined and customizable sequence and calibration procedures can facilitate
if not completely automate complex processes. The Section on <a class="reference internal" href="sequencer.html#sequencer"><span class="std std-ref">Sequencer</span></a>
describes the sequencing system in more detail.</p>
<div class="figure" id="observing-execution">
<img alt="../../_images/obs_execution_quality_control.png" src="../../_images/obs_execution_quality_control.png" />
</div>
<p>During observations (<a class="reference internal" href="#observing-execution"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 35</span></a>) the telescope
operator controls and monitors the health of the telescope, instruments,
enclosure, and other facility equipment using real-time telemetry data, which is
also stored into the engineering data archive for future analysis. The observer,
who may be a visiting scientist for classical observing, or an
observatory/instrument scientist for queue observing, directs the sequence of
targets for observations based on runtime judgments of observing conditions or
from a queue scheduler.  Sky visualization tools provide observers situational
awareness of their target sky trajectories throughout the night relative to
potential guide stars (for non-sidereal targets), the moon, clouds, wind
direction, and elevation, and telescope limits. During observations, a sequencer
oversees and choreographs the timing of hardware and software execution. Due to
the complexity of the GMT optical-mechanical systems, all activities that take
place during runtime operations, including all instrument and telescope
controls, and all observations, will involve a combination of sequencing and
human validation.  Observers may create, customize, or augment existing,
observing sequences according to their science observing requirements, such as
commanding mosaic patterns, dithering off and on-source exposures,
starting/stopping exposure sequences, acquiring guide stars, etc.</p>
<p>After a science exposure is complete and read out, raw metadata and pixel data
arriving from the telescope are stored into the observatory archive permanently.
Simultaneously, they are automatically processed via a pipeline for data
calibration. The pipeline recognizes data types based on metadata (i.e., image
headers) and directs the flow of the reduction accordingly. The data calibration
pipeline produces an image that is ideally free of instrumental signatures. The
output may then be piped through other data pipelines, such as spectral
extraction or more advanced states of image/spectroscopy combination (e.g.,
stacking, mosaic, data cube creation, etc.). All raw and processed data,
maintenance procedures, logs, telemetry, documentation, and other instrument
data, maintained and stored in the GMTO archival database, will be fully
accessible and searchable.</p>
<p><strong>Observing Sequence Life Cycle</strong></p>
<p>The Figure below represents the states of an Observation Sequence (OS) during
its life cycle. These states are the basis for the visualization of flow in the
Observatory Workflow Manager, which follows the concept of a Kanban panel (i.e.,
a scheduling system for lean production). <a class="reference internal" href="#observation-life-cycle"><span class="std std-numref">Table 13</span></a> describes the states.  Although an Observation
Sequence is used as example, the model extends to any kind of automated tasks.
Observation Sequences are a subclass of the more generic Operation Sequence;
these may automate calibration, diagnosis or other engineering Tasks.</p>

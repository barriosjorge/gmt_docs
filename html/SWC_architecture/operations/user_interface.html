<p>The Operations User Interface (OPUI) provides an integrated way to support GMT
operations.  While the engineering user interfaces provide comprehensive access
to the functionality of any subsystem, as described in
<a class="reference internal" href="../services/common/engineering_UI.html#services-engineering-ui"><span class="std std-ref">Engineering User Interface Service</span></a>, the OPUI supports the operational workflows of
the Observatory.</p>
<p>Designed to be flexible, the OPUI can adapt to different operation scenarios,
which may be refined or may evolve as operations are optimized over time. Its
components are deployed in a web browser. The visualization components access
server side information using <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a> for streaming information like
telemetry and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> interfaces for
configuration or static information.  Coupled with the web-based OPUI, the
observatory operation workflows define and allow tasks to be performed by
different users or teams located in different geographical locations (e.g., GMT
site control room, remote observing center, or science operation center). The
operation scenarios may be refined or may evolve as operations are optimized
over time. In order to provide these capabilities, the architecture of the OPUI
is based on a set of modular components that can be arranged according to
operation scenarios.</p>
<p>The design of user interfaces can greatly impact the operational efficiency of
the observatory. A carefully designed OPUI provides the following benefits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Provides a uniform look and feel that guarantees consistent behavior of user
interface elements. Consistent behavior makes the system predictable and
facilitates a deeper understanding of functionalities that may be critical.</li>
<li>Provides a common visual and conceptual layout that facilitates
communication between different operators or between teams working
simultaneously.</li>
<li>Simplifies the documentation of user interfaces as many aspects can be
described from common principles instead of detailed descriptions.
Nevertheless the system will allow detailed views into the metadata that
make up any UI component or element.</li>
<li>Simplifies training, especially from remote locations, and reduces human
errors.</li>
<li>Enables the development of &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; benefiting from familiarity with
the same layout and taking advantage of peripheral view.</li>
<li>Facilitates localization of problems during troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Enables users early on to provide critical feedback and refinements on
operational scenarios and procedures, which in turn feeds back requirements
for the whole system.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 4.6 </span><span class="caption-text">Control Room User Interface Layout. Six 24” equivalent screens organized in
two horizontal rows are used to provide the necessary real state. This
layout is likely to change as the display technology evolves.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The Figure above shows the layout of a workstation in the control room to
control the telescope and the facility. This layout can be similar in a remote
operation center, potentially limited only by the refresh rate (24 fps) of the
network infrastructure, required for high bandwidth telemetry visualization
(e.g., wavefront pixels). This layout strikes a balance in information density
and visualization efficiency. It consists of two horizontal strips. The top
strip, always visible, provides an overview of the status of the system.
Visualization components are arranged, left to right, following the physical
location of hardware equipment from the external environment to the instrument
detector.  This strip is fixed and enables the development of common visual cues
that facilitates the communication between system operators.</p>
<p>The components in the bottom strip are organized following a temporal, i.e.
workflow arrangement, from left to right, &#8220;TO DO&#8221;, &#8220;IN PROGRESS&#8221;, &#8220;DONE&#8221; areas.
The left &#8220;TO DO&#8221; side is designed to manage work that is pending and to
visualize the workflow of the observatory. The left area is focused on choosing
and preparing upcoming observations. The central region provides a view of what
is currently been executed in the system. During observations, the main
interface is the observation Sequencer. The right side provides information on
an observation that has just finished and enables one to perform quality control
and to process instrument data.</p>
<p>By intent, the left and right side of both strips are also aligned to complement
each other. For example, environmental information on the left is paired with
the visualization of short term observing sequence candidates while, on the
right side, instrument and detector status are paired with quick look and
quality control panels. In the center, panels that show status on the laser and
wavefront control loops are aligned with the real-time step sequencer to provide
efficient real-time monitoring of the system.</p>
<p>In the case of classical observing mode, a single person may perform all the
necessary steps from left to right. In queue or service mode, several persons,
perhaps distributed in different or distant locations, may collaborate to carry
out operations. For example, one team or person can focus on preparing a short
list of observations for the night, while another may focus on the on-going
observation. Another person may be analyzing the results from previous
observations and monitoring the (re)processing of science data. The parallel
execution of these activities maximizes observing efficiency.</p>
<p>Some variations can branch off from the basic “double strip” configuration to
better address specialized use cases, e.g., AO, Instrument or telescope centered
workstations. Some of the panels can be standalone in other contexts, e.g., the
workflow panel (<a class="reference internal" href="#kanban-workflow"><span class="std std-ref">Kanban Workflow panel</span></a>) can be deployed
in large screens in critical areas of the observatory to provide a global view
of the work in progress at the observatory. Some of the panels are intended to
exploit the benefits of different portable media, e.g., tablets, phones or
laptops. Tablets and augmented reality displays already provide access to
information in the operations of industrial plants. Observatory engineers
diagnosing problems outside the control room can send commands remotely and
immediately witness the results without running to-and-forth. This ability
relies on having proper groupings of informational panels.</p>
<p>Although the OPUI is composed of several panels, the description of all of them
is outside the scope of this document and their detailed design will proceed
accordingly in future stages of the project. The observatory workflow panel is
presented as an example as it provides an overall view of the work at the
observatory. This panel is designed according to principles derived from Lean
and Agile management, following basic principles on the visualization of
quantitative data:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Information access – Information is accessible to inform operator decisions
without the need to search multilevel menus or to click on several
&#8220;disclosure triangles.&#8221;</li>
<li>Data presentation – Quantitative data are presented in a way to facilitate
comparisons of relevant criteria and to promote understanding of the
statistical distribution of the datasets.</li>
<li>Visualization of workflow – In order for users to comprehend or reason
through various activities that take place in an observatory, it is
important to provide an easy, uniform, and global, visualization to
understand the different observatory workflows. The visualization of
observatory activities is based on the notion of Kanban boards. A Kanban
(scheduling system) provides an ability to represent items of interest and
to track their progress through different stages in a production process.
Observatory analogies include the process of an observation, or of solving
hardware “bugs.”</li>
<li>Monitoring, adaptation, and improvement – The use of performance metrics
that are updated in real time allows one to detect bottlenecks and to take
relief measures. Both human tasks/activities and automated tasks,
engineering and observation activities, can be depicted on the Observatory
Flow board.  Real-time feedback on performance enables operations staff to
understand the implications of reallocating work unit (e.g., observing
block) from one step in a process to another: when one unit of work changes
state (to do -&gt; execution -&gt; complete), how much all other criteria are
affected are rigorously quantified and immediately updated. One of the goals
is to provide a set of tools that is sufficiently general, that benefits,
but that does not tailor to a specific operation mode (classical observing,
queue, etc.). For example, in classical observing mode, only the PI decides
which process items (e.g., observations) move from one stage to another.
However, the collaborating observers can be distributed in different
locations around the world to take advantage of normal daytime work hours in
some time zones.</li>
<li>Pull work from stage to stage – Geographically distributed teams can pull
work units from stage to stage. Observing and scheduling tools assist in the
tasks of moving work units through the system.</li>
<li>Limit work-in-progress – Excessive number of work units in a stage limits
the productivity of the teams responsible for those work units. Visualizing
the practical limits of work-in- progress for every stage enables one to
identify possible planning deficiencies, to cue the teams to take corrective
measures, and to continuously improve the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>The integration of the software components in the overall GMT system engineering
effort follows tailored-compliance with the ISO 12207 standard <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#iso12207" id="id1">[ISO12207]</a>,
whereas the software development is based on an iterative Agile development
process. Agile planning is based on implementing features that will be needed in
the system instead of defining the tasks necessary to produce them. When
planning and developing by feature, the team has a better understanding of the
system and the plan is easily followed by other members of the project. The key
to iterative development is to frequently, and from early on, produce working
versions of the final system that have a subset of the required features. These
working systems are short on functionality, but should otherwise be faithful to
the demands of the final system. They are fully integrated and as carefully
tested as a final delivery.</p>
<div class="section" id="domain-engineering-process">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>9.2.1. <em>Domain Engineering Process</em><a class="headerlink" href="#domain-engineering-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SWCS development process starts with domain engineering (clause 7.3.1 of
ISO12207 <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#iso12207" id="id3">[ISO12207]</a>), which allows one to identify the main architectural
components of the SWCS and to group them into uniform categories of subsystems,
packages and components according to the cohesion of functionalities, timing
requirements, and the sizes of the interfaces. The output of the domain analysis
process is used as the base for the definition of the SWC Product Breakdown
Structure (PBS). The PBS is based on the decomposition of the system into High
Level Domains, Subsystems, Packages and Components (PBS components are captured
as instances of metamodel entities).</p>
<div class="figure" id="id10">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 9.1 </span><span class="caption-text">Overall Process View</span></p>
</div>
<p>The SWC WBS is generated in a canonical way based on the Product Tree with the
addition of work packages that take into account management support activities
(e.g., development or commissioning plans, component architectural prototypes).
The Figure below shows the top-level structure of the SWC product tree. 1.3.3 –
1.3.5 WBS details are omitted as they are presented in previous sections. The
Software and Controls WBS Report <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#filg13c" id="id4">[Filg13c]</a> document and the Software and
Controls Product Tree Report <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#matr13" id="id5">[MaTr13]</a>  describe both of them in detail.</p>

</div>
<p>In addition to the work packages 1.3.2 – 1.3.5 described in previous sections
the work package 1.3.1, Software and Control Engineering and Management includes
all the activities and resources needed to support the software development.</p>
<p>At the end of this phase the following outcome is produced:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The identification of all the subsystems</li>
<li>The identification of the interfaces</li>
<li>A formal reference architecture captured in a domain model</li>
<li>A cost estimation</li>
<li>An initial definition of the backlog for the development of every subsystem.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section" id="subsystem-development">
<h2>9.2.2. <em>Subsystem Development</em><a class="headerlink" href="#subsystem-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SWC System is treated as a system of systems in terms of planning
activities.  The development of each SWC subsystem is organized in four
sequential phases or macro-sprints in Agile terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Phase 1</strong> – Subsystem specification performs the initial requirement
analysis, the organization of the Subsystem in Packages and Components and
the creation of the initial product backlog.  “Product backlog” is a common
term used in Agile management to refer to the functionality, e.g. user
stories or features, that have to be developed. For control subsystems,
Phase 1 generally starts after the preliminary design of the system under
control.  However, Phase 1 may start earlier to support preliminary design
of the hardware subsystem if the necessary requirements to do so are
sufficiently developed.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2</strong> – Design sprint implements the high priority, high value,
Subsystem features.  The assignment of priorities to features takes into
account which ones are likely to provide: better feedback about the design
of the Subsystem, important information that help to identify and mitigate
risks in designs (e.g., a particular algorithm that requires computing power
at the limit of the proposed hardware platform), or a higher business value.
Subsystem features also include hooks necessary to support eventual hardware
prototypes.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3</strong> – Construction sprint implements the bulk of the subsystem
features backlog. At the end of this phase all the features necessary to
perform the Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) of the system under control
have been developed, integrated, tested and deployed.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 4</strong> – AIT sprint implements the rest of the product backlog. AIT
sprint includes the development of features that require most of the
Components to be already implemented. It also includes potential changes as
a result of the FAT.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="figure" id="id12">
<img alt="../../_images/software_development_phases.png" src="../../_images/software_development_phases.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 9.3 </span><span class="caption-text">Software Development Phases. The inception or Requirements Phase produces the
initial backlog of a subsystem features.  Features are prioritized and
assigned to subsequent phases. Each phase is constrained by project
milestones like on-site integration or factory acceptance testing.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In this subsystem development strategy each phase can be seen as a ‘standard’
Agile project. This suits the multiyear development span of the GMT
optomechanical systems. Although, initially, the software system naturally lags
the hardware in design and development, the software system generally outpaces
the hardware to arrive at the final integration and commissioning phase of the
mechatronic system.</p>
<p>Each phase or super-sprint is divided into a sequence of iterations, typically
of one-month duration. Iterative development allows measurements and control of
progress. At the end of every iteration, a retrospective review takes place to
analyze problems found during the development process and to present the results
to the subsystem stakeholders. A retrospective analysis is also held at the end
of every phase to analyze the features developed and to restate priorities if
necessary.</p>
<p>It is easy to plan an entire project using standard tasks without really
understanding the system being built. Agile planning is based on implementing
features that will be needed in the system instead of tasks. When planning by
feature, the team has a better understanding of the system and the plan is easy
follow by other members of the project.</p>
<p>The approach of incremental delivery and the refinement of the software features
map naturally to a telescope project where many of the software systems follow
the design of their mechanical counterpart. The same is true about the top-tier
software components that must support the operation plans of the observatory,
which are also often refined during the life cycle of the project. Moreover the
incremental implementation of the features provides more value or addresses
higher risks that then feedback and help to better refine non-software
observatory systems.</p>

<span id="id6"></span><h2>9.2.3. <em>Subsystem Specification and Modeling</em><a class="headerlink" href="#subsystem-specification-and-modeling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Level 5 requirements are captured in System Definition Files (SDF). SDFs are
written using a Domain Specific Language (DSL). A DSL is a computer programming
language of limited expressiveness focused on a particular domain47. A DSL
facilitates productivity and communication with domain experts. At the same time
the use of a DSL helps to involve domain experts in building the model and the
system.</p>
<p>The use of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) provides a formal syntax and
semantics that reduces the ambiguity of the specifications. The concrete syntax
is provided by the DSL, while the semantics are given by a set of models
following the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.omg.org/mof/">Object Management Group Meta Object Facility</a> architecture. The SDFs are ASCII files that are
parsed and stored in the semantic model database and processed for consistency
and completeness. They are hosted in the GMT central software private repository
in Github (Figure below), for access by the GMT software community and revision
control. The use of Github features allows participants to comment and carry on
discussions directly in the model repository.</p>
<p>SDF are being developed as the design of the systems under control moves
forward. A first generation set has been produced as part of the Domain
Engineering process. The Figure below shows the GMT model homepage on Github.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 9.4 </span><span class="caption-text">GMT Software Github Page</span></p>
</div>
<p>The use of SDFs enables the following features:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Subsystem build dependencies</li>
<li>Generation of Subsystem test configuration and test data</li>
<li>Subsystem software deployment</li>
<li>Subsystem metadata (e.g., on-line documentation, component introspection)</li>
<li>Integration with support tools</li>
<li>A method to provide inheritance mechanism to specialized specification from
more general ones</li>
<li>An ability to define, initially, the specification based on interfaces</li>
<li>Systematic ways to guarantee uniform architectural design and specification
based on a reference architecture optimized for the domain (observatory and
telescope control).</li>
<li>Clear and formal feature specifications; the semantics are defined formally
in a metamodel.</li>
<li>Storage and further processing of the specifications in a database. The
specifications are available during runtime to provide introspection
mechanisms.</li>
<li>An ability to allow fine grain changes and management of the specification
files, as they are under configuration control.</li>
<li>Direct traceability between requirements/specification and implementation.
Some tools have been developed that allow the generation of runtime
scaffolding and skeletons.</li>
<li>Documentation support, where documents are rendered from the specification
files in RST. Through the use of the Sphinx <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#sphi13" id="id7">[Sphi13]</a>  package,
documentation can be produced in Latex, PDF and HTML formats. Templates
have been defined for most of the documents required in the SWCS Handbook.

<h2>9.2.4. <em>Software Quality Assurance Process</em><a class="headerlink" href="#software-quality-assurance-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Software Quality Assurance process is based in the ISO/IEC 12207 Software
Quality Assurance Process. The purpose of this process is to provide assurance
that work products and processes comply with predefined provisions and plans.
The quality assurance process is coordinated with the related Software
Verification, Software Validation, Software Review, Software Audit, and Software
Problem Resolution processes. The Software and Controls Handbook section on
Software Engineering and Quality Assurance includes the ISO/IEC 12207 conformity
Matrix for these processes.</p>
<p>The SWCS will implement standard processes, and utilize commercial products
whenever possible, for the management of software source code, builds,
releases, issue tracking and distribution. An overview of these tools, the MDE
methodology and the “Agile” management process are presented in the Section
10.6 (TBA?, Software &amp; Controls Risks).</p>
<p><strong>Software Verification Process</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The purpose of the Software Verification Process is to confirm that each
software work product and/or service of a process reflects the specified
requirements. Several techniques are employed to implement the verification
process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The capability of SWCS components to operate in on-line or simulated mode
enables testing interfaces early in the development cycle.</li>
<li>The capability of SWCS components to operate in integrated or standalone
mode enables to test components without the need of the observatory services
in place. This is useful for the initial steps in the implementation of a
component.</li>
<li>Automated tests for subsystem and component are generated from the formal
specifications defined in the corresponding SDFs facilitating the
traceability between requirements and tests.</li>
<li>The SWCS Handbook defines deliverables and policy for Factory Acceptance
Testing (FAT) and Site Acceptance Testing (SAT).</li>
<li>In the case of critical system formal verification can be performed using
Sequence Base Specification <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#prow96" id="id8">[Prow96]</a> (SBS) or Cleanroom techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9.2.5. <em>Software Configuration Management Process</em><a class="headerlink" href="#software-configuration-management-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of the Software Configuration Management Process is to establish and
maintain the integrity of the software items of the SWCS and make them available
to concerned parties. The software configuration management (SCM) provides a
framework to uniformly support several aspects of the software development
process and delivery stages:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Source management</li>
<li>Release management</li>
<li>Build management</li>
<li>Deployment management</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The SCM adopts a paradigm of convention over configuration, allowing different
3rd-party tools to interact somewhat transparently with minimum development
needed to build a framework.</p>
<p><strong>Source Management</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>GMTO uses Git <a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography/bibliography.html#chac14" id="id9">[Chac14]</a> for source code management. As stated by the developer
(<a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com">git-scm.com</a>), “Git is a free and open source
distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to
very large projects with speed and efficiency.” Git features include cheap
local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.</p>
<p>GMTO repositories are hosted on Github, which offers private repositories for
organizations at modest cost. Github offers additional features detailed in
the following sections, and provides an API to manage resources (repositories,
user profiles, organizations, etc.) programmatically. Hosting on the Cloud
alleviates several IT logistics burdens compared to a self-hosting solution:
VPN and/or private network, backup, availability, authentication etc. As a
distributed system, Git makes each working copy effectively function as a
remote backup of the codebase and of its change history, providing inherent
protection against loss. Additionally, a backup of a master local copy is
store for enhanced safety.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Release Management</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Release management of the individual modules is handled by tags. A simple
&#8220;semantic versioning&#8221; is established using the following tag convention:
major.minor[.build[.revision]], where:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Major number is increased when there are significant jumps in
functionality, possible break in API backward compatibility</li>
<li>Minor number is incremented when only minor features or significant fixes
have been added</li>
<li>Build is optionally alpha, beta, rc (release candidate)</li>
<li>Revision number is incremented when minor bugs are fixed Additional
semantics possible: odd-even system, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Release management of the entire system (i.e., all the collection of software
and configuration), is provided by the GMT model. Each individual subsystem
defines release information and keywords to allow the creation and re-creation
of well-identified, repeatable, release &#8220;snapshot&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tools will allow querying and updating of the model. In its simplest form a
text editor is enough, but more advanced capabilities will allow one to
generate dependency trees and deployment information, to identify and resolve
conflicts, to check runtime version, to upgrade mechanism automation, to
sign-off feature working with SCM, etc.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Build Management</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div>A standard software build facility is provided, including directory structure,
environment, configuration files, Makefiles, spec file, distutil file, etc. as
applicable.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Deployment Management</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>GMTO uses rpm and yum for software package management on its Linux platform.
Workflows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Extract release tag from model</li>
<li>Checkout source from git</li>
<li>Build rpm</li>

However, a minimum set of documentation is necessary to address GMT specific
characteristics:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>GMT is a multidisciplinary project that requires communication with
engineers from disciplines other than software.</li>
<li>GMT requires producing “stage-gate” documents to support project reviews.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The GMT documentation system tries to address both issues, without creating a
burden on the software development process. The strategy is to provide a
high-level handbook that helps to navigate the software system and to provide
mechanisms to generate documentation from specification files.</p>
<p>The Software and Controls Handbook provides a one-stop document to address all
the information necessary for the development of GMT software and control
systems. The Handbook includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>An overview of the SWCS Reference Architecture</li>
<li>A set of requirements that all the subsystems have to meet</li>
<li>A list of software and hardware standards</li>
<li>A catalog of recommended components</li>
<li>A set of recommendations and guidelines</li>
<li>An overview of the development strategy</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The documentation of the entire software system is automatically generated from
subsystem and model definition files (SDFs and MDFs), which, at every moment,
are synchronized with the specification and the design of the system. At the
same time the method reduces the amount of work necessary to produce documents.
The documentation is extracted from the specification files and rendered into
reader-friendly formats using the Sphinx76 package. LaTeX, PDF, html and RST
formats are available. The table below provides a documentation overview of the
available templates.</p>

<h2>9.2.7. <em>Software Integration Process</em><a class="headerlink" href="#software-integration-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of the Software Integration Process is to combine the software
subsystems and software components, producing integrated software system,
consistent with the software design, that demonstrate that the functional and
non-functional software requirements are satisfied on an equivalent or complete
operational platform. The SWCS uses a Continuous Integration (CI) system that
ensures that integration problems are discovered early in the development cycle.
Both software packages developed by the PO and by partner institutions are
integrated and tested early in the project. SDFs provide all the information
necessary to build and integrate the different subsystems, which facilitates the
implementation of a continuous integration system. OTS CI tools like Jenkins*
provide ready to use solutions.</p>
<p>Partial hardware simulators are used during the initial development of Device
Control Subsystems to identify issues with field interface electronics before
the integration with the final hardware devices.</p>

<h2>9.2.8. <em>Development Workflows</em><a class="headerlink" href="#development-workflows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As part of the domain engineering process a set of development workflows has
been identified. While the ISO/IEC 12207 process is generic, Workflows are
specific to the GMT project. They define concrete step-by-step processes for the
developing of the most frequently utilized software components (e.g., Controller
Development Workflow).</p>
<p>The development Workflows are also specified using SDFs. This allows the use of
the same tools for generating documentation and the support for improvement,
once the GMT software community starts developing software. The table below
provides an overview of the main SWCS Development Workflows:</p>

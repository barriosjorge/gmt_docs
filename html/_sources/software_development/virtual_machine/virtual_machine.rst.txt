Installing a Virtual Machine
============================

A Virtual Machine allows for the creation of a development environment within
any host computer, and provides a way to quickly start developing without the
need for specialized equipment.

VirtualBox is a free application that can quickly and easily create Virtual
Machines capable of running most operating systems. This is a guide for setting
up a Virtual Machine for GMT SWC development.

.. note::
  Needless to say, there are situations where a Virtual Machine should not be
  used, for example when the system requires physical interfaces that cannot be
  easily simulated in a Virtual Environment.

Download Virtual Box
--------------------

The latest versions of VirtualBox can be found here:
`<https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_

Download and install the correct version, depending on which host machine will
be used. For the purposes of this guide, we will be installing VirtualBox
version 5.1.20, for use on OS X.

Install VirtualBox

  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Name and Operating System

Choose a descriptive **Name** for the Virtual Machine and select the **Type**
as *Linux* and the **Version** as *Red Hat (64-bit)*.

Select *Continue* to proceed.

.. image:: images/ss06_new_memory_size.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Memory Size

The amount of memory allocated to the Virtual Machine can be varied depending
on how much memory is available to the host machine and how heavily the
Virtual Machine will be utilized. At this stage, *2 GB* is more than sufficient.
It can be changed after the Virtual Machine has been set up, if necessary.

Select *Continue* to proceed.

.. image:: images/ss07_new_hard_disk.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Hard Disk

Select **Create a virtual hard disk now**, to set up a hard drive.
This will be a file on the host machine that can dynamically resize based
on demand, up to a specified maximum value.

Select *Create* to proceed.

.. image:: images/ss08_new_hard_disk_type.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Hard Disk File Type

Select the default, **VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)**, and then click
*Continue* to proceed.

.. image:: images/ss09_new_hard_disk_storage.png

  :alt: Storage on Physical Hard Disk

Select the default, **Dynamically allocated**, and then click
*Continue* to proceed.

.. image:: images/ss10_new_hard_disk_location_size.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: File Location and Size

The amount of disk space allocated to the Virtual Machine can be varied
depending on how much disk space is available to the host machine and the
hardware requirements of the Virtual Machine.
The host machine will only be impacted by the actual size of the virtual
machine file system because the virtual drive space is allocated dynamically.
At this stage 20 GB is sufficient.
The minimum capacity for the SWC development machine is 5 GB.

Select *Create* to proceed.

  :alt: VirtualBox Main Window

The Virtual Machine is now set up and ready to use.
The system properties of the VM can be changed whenever it is turned off
by selecting the VM and clicking on Settings.

Configure Network Settings
--------------------------

To allow the virtual machine to access the internet, we need to bridge the
VM's network adapter to the host machine's network adapter.

Select the VM and click on *Settings*, then select the *Network* icon on
the top row.

.. image:: images/ss12_network_settings.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Network Adapter Settings

Enable Network Adapter 1 and set it to be **attached to** *Bridged Adapter*
with **Name** the same as the network adapter used by the host machine to
connect to the internet. In this case, it's the wireless adapter *en0*.
The settings under **Advanced** can remain on defaults.

Select *OK* to save settings and close the dialog.

Download the iso image
----------------------

Before running the virtual machine for the first time, download the iso image
that will be used to install the operating system and other critical packages.

The iso file can be found here:
`standalone.iso <http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/iso/standalone.iso>`_
Download this file to the host machine.

For alternative instructions on how to download and verify this file,
go to :ref:`installation`

Run the Virtual Machine
-----------------------

Double-click the VM in the left pane or select the VM and click "Start".

.. image:: images/ss13_first_run_iso.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: First Run

Browse to the *standalone.iso* file downloaded before and click *Start*.
This will mount the iso into a Virtual Optical Drive and select it as the boot
device.

  :alt: First Run Install Menu

Press down and select *install* to install the GMTO operating system.

.. note::
  At this point it is useful to note that when you click on the Virtual Machine
  window, the keyboard and mouse is automatically captured for use by the guest.
  The Host-key, by default ``Left Command`` on OS X, will release the mouse and keyboard
  for use by the host.  The status is shown by the mouse and arrow icons on the
  bottom-right of the screen alongside a reminder of which key has been
  configured as the host key.

  To change to host key, select **VirtualBox VM -> Preferences** from the
  application control bar. Select the **Input** tab and edit the value next
  to the *Host Key Combination field*.

The system is now ready to use for development.

Helpful Tips using VirtualBox
-----------------------------

**Multiple Terminals**

By default, the virtual machine will start the terminal in tty1.
To switch to other terminals use ``fn-alt-<Fkey>``.

+--------------+---------------+
| tty1         | fn-alt-F1     |
+--------------+---------------+
| tty2         | fn-alt-F2     |
+--------------+---------------+
| tty3         | fn-alt-F3     |
+--------------+---------------+
| etc.         |               |
+--------------+---------------+

Multiple terminals can be used at the same time.

.. note::
  Environment variables that are temporarily set using the *export* command will
  only be set on the current terminal. If there are multiple terminals open,
  either export the variable individually on all terminals or permanently set the
  environment variables in the appropriate bash configuration files.

**Scrolling**

To scroll up in the terminal, use ``fn-shift-<up arrow>`` and
``fn-shift-<down arrow>``.


VirtualBox Guest Additions (Optional)
-------------------------------------
It's often useful to be able to share files and folders between the host
machine and the virtual machine. To enable this functionality, VirtualBox
requires **Guest Additions** to be installed. This process is optional.

First, we need to update the kernel and existing packages

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo yum update

Log out and shut down the virtual machine.
Restart the virtual machine and boot with the latest kernel
*(for example Fedora 4.8.13-100.fc23.x86_64)*

.. image:: images/ss22_kernel_update.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Boot with latest Kernel

Install additional packages

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo yum install bzip2
    $ sudo yum install kernel-devel

With the Virtual Machine running, select
**Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image...** on the application control bar.

Now, find the device ID assigned to the optical drive containing the
Guest Additions CD image.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ blkid

.. image:: images/ss23_blkid_mount_cd.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Mount Optical Drive

In this case, the device ID is ``/dev/sr0``.

Create a folder under */media* and use it to mount the CD rom.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir /media/cd
    $ sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cd

Install VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest machine:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /media/cd
    $ sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run install

.. image:: images/ss24_vbox_install_guestadditions.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Install VirtualBox Guest Additions

Create a shared folder on the host.

Select **Devices -> Shared Folders -> Shared Folder Settings...**

Click the *Add* icon on the right-hand side, select the *Folder* to use on the
host machine and give it a name.

Select "Auto-mount" to automatically link the folders at start-up and
"Make Permanent" to create a machine folder and not a temporary folder.

.. image:: images/ss25_shared_folder.png
  :align: center
  :scale: 70 %
  :alt: Configuring a Shared Folder

Click *OK* to save the settings.

Restart the Virtual Machine. The shared folder will be mounted at ``/media/sf_share``.

For easy folder access, add the current user to the vboxsf group:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo usermod -aG vboxsf gmto

You may need to log out and in again for the changes to take effect.

If you'd like to mount the folder manually, ensure that the "Auto-mount"
setting is not selected. Then, create a folder in the virtual machine to use,
for example ``~/share``.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~
    $ mkdir share
    $ sudo mount -t vboxsf share ~/share

Where "share" is the name given to the folder during configuration,
potentially matching the folder name on the host and "~/share" is the
location of the folder on the virtual machine.

In this case, the gmto user does not need to be added to the vboxsf group to
allow full access to the folder.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Logging Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is an issue starting the logging service, check that the mongo DB
process is running and try to restart the service.

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ systemctl status -l mongod
      $ sudo service mongod restart

If the problem persists, check the log file for information on why the service is unable to start

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo less /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

If, for example, the error *Insufficient free space for journal files* is shown in the log,
it can be fixed by editing the mongod configuration file to set *smallfiles = true*.
This may be the case if a smaller hard drive size was selected for a virtual machine.

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo vim /etc/mongod.conf

Restart the service and check the status again.

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo service mongod restart
      $ systemctl status -l mongod

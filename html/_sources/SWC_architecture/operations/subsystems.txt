Operations Subsystems
---------------------

The entire domain of Observatory Operations is summarized in Figure 10-40 and
consists of the following subsystems: operations user interface, observing
tools, scheduling, sequencing, aircraft safety, laser traffic control safety,
spacecraft safety, quality management, data archiving, and data processing. Each
of the subsystems will be described in their respective sections.

The Section on ":ref:`architecture-modules`" describes the partitioning of the
Subsystems into Packages of Components. In each of the OPS subsystems,
:numref:`Figure %s <observatory_operations_subsystems>`, there is the following
set of packages that implement different categories of functions, including:
supervision, visualization, sequencing, diagnosis, workflow management, and
hardware deployment.

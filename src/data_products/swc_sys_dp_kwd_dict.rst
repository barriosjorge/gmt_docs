        9-80 shall be filled with ASCII blanks.
    * - *extlevel*
      - EXTLEVEL
      - Hierarchical level of the extension
      - Integer
      - extension
      - The value field shall contain an integer, specifying the level in a
        hierarchy of extension levels of the extension header containing it. 
        The value shall be 1 for the highest level; levels with a higher value
        of this keyword shall be subordinate to levels with a lower value. If
        the EXTLEVEL keyword is absent, the file should be treated as if the
        value were 1. This keyword is used to describe an extension and should
        not appear in the primary header.
    * - *extend*
      - EXTEND
      - Indicates whether the FITS file contain extensions
      - Boolean
      - primary
      - T or F indicating whether the FITS file is allowed to contain
        conforming extensions following the primary HDU.  This keyword MUST
        NOT appear in XtensionFrame.  Contains a logical value indicating
        whether the FITS file is allowed to contain conforming extensions
        following the primary HDU. This keyword may only appear in the primary
        header and must not appear in an extension header.  If the value field
        is T then there may be conforming extensions in the FITS file
        following the primary HDU.  This keyword is only advisory, so its
        presence with a value T does not require that the FITS file contains
        extensions, nor does the absence of this keyword necessarily imply
        that the file does not contain extensions.
    * - *nextend*
      - NEXTEND
      - The number of standard extensions
      - Integer
      - primary
      - Number of standard extensions

      - EXTNAME
      - Name of the extension
      - String
      - extension
      - The value field shall contain a character string, to be used to
        distinguish among different extensions of the same type, i.e., with
        the same value of XTENSION, in a FITS file.  This keyword is used to
        describe an extension and should not appear in the primary header. The
        extension types are: SCI (science image), ERR (error image), DQ (data
        quality image), SAMP (number of sample), TIME (exposure time), EVENTS
        (photon event list), GTI (good time interval), WHT (weight image), CTX
        (context image).
    * - *extver*
      - EXTVER
      - Version of the extension
      - Integer
      - extension
      - The value field shall contain an integer, to be used to distinguish
        among different extensions in a FITS file with the same type and name,
        i.e., the same values for XTENSION and EXTNAME. The values need not
        start with 1 for the first extension with a particular value of
        EXTNAME and need not be in sequence for subsequent values. If the
        EXTVER keyword is absent, the file should be treated as if the value
        were 1.  This keyword is used to describe an extension and should not
        appear in the primary header.
    * - *gcount*
      - GCOUNT
      - Group count
      - Integer
      - extension
      - The value field shall contain an integer that shall be used in any way
        appropriate to define the data structure, consistent with Eq.  5.2 in
        the FITS Standard.  This keyword originated for use in FITS Random
        Groups where it specifies the number of random groups present.  In
        most other cases this keyword will have the value 1.  Must have the
        value 1 in the IMAGE, Table, and BINTABLE standard extensions. 
    * - *groups*
      - GROUPS
      - Indicates random groups structure
      - Boolean

        associated with this keyword implies that random groups records are
        present.
    * - *history*
      - HISTORY
      - Processing history of the data
      - String
      - any
      - This keyword shall have no associated value; columns 9-80 may contain
        any ASCII text.  The text should contain a history of steps and
        procedures associated with the processing of the associated data.  Any
        number of HISTORY card images may appear in a header.
    * - *instrume*
      - INSTRUME
      - Name of instrument
      - String

      - Integer
      - any
      - The value field shall contain a non-negative integer no greater than
        999, representing the number of axes in the associated data array. A
        value of zero signifies that no data follow the header in the HDU.  In
        the context of FITS 'TABLE' or 'BINTABLE' extensions, the value of
        NAXIS is always 2.
    * - *naxisn*
      - NAXISn
      - Size along the axis n dimension
      - Integer
      - any
      - The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a non-negative
        integer, representing the number of elements along axis n of a data
        array.  The NAXISn must be present for all values n = 1,...,NAXIS, and
        for no other values of n. A value of zero for any of the NAXISn
        signifies that no data follow the header in the HDU. If NAXIS is equal
        to 0, there should not be any NAXISn keywords.
    * - *naxis1*
      - NAXIS1
      - Size along the axis 1 dimension

      - String
      - any
      - The value field shall contain a character string giving a name or type
        of the object observed.  Often 'TARGNAME' is used for target name, in
        which case 'OBJECT' can be used to specify the object category.
    * - *observer*
      - OBSERVER
      - Observer who acquired the data
      - String
      - any
      - The value field shall contain a character string identifying who
        acquired the data associated with the header.
    * - *origin*
      - ORIGIN
      - Organization responsible for the data
      - String

    * - *pcount*
      - PCOUNT
      - Parameter Count
      - Integer
      - extension
      - The value field shall contain an integer that shall be used in any way
        appropriate to define the data structure, consistent with Eq. 5.2 in
        the FITS Standard.   This keyword was originated for use with FITS
        Random Groups and represented the number of parameters preceding each
        group. It has since been used in 'BINTABLE' extensions to represent
        the size of the data heap following the main data table.  In most
        other cases its value will be zero.  Must have value of 0 for IMAGE
        and TABLE extensions.  In BINTABLE, the value specifies the number of
        bytes that follow the main data table in the supplemental data area
        called the heap. This keyword is also used in the random groups
        structure to specify the number of parameters preceding each array in
        a group.
    * - *pscaln*
      - PSCALn
      - Parameter scaling factor
      - Float
      - extension
      - This keyword is reserved for use within the FITS Random Groups
        structure.  This keyword shall be used, along with the PZEROn keyword,
        when the nth FITS group parameter value is not the true physical
        value, to transform the group parameter value to the true physical
        values it represents, using the equation, physical_value = PZEROn +
        PSCALn * group_parameter_value.  The value field shall contain a
        floating point number representing the coefficient of the linear term,
        the scaling factor between true values and group parameter values at
        zero offset.  The default value for this keyword is 1.0.
    * - *ptypen*
      - PTYPEn
      - Name of random groups parameter
      - String
      - extension
      - This keyword is reserved for use within the FITS Random Groups
        structure.  The value field shall contain a character string giving
        the name of parameter n.  If the PTYPEn keywords for more than one
        value of n have the same associated name in the value field, then the
        data value for the parameter of that name is to be obtained by adding
        the derived data values of the corresponding parameters.  This rule
        provides a mechanism by which a random parameter may have more
        precision than the accompanying data array elements; for example, by
        summing two 16-bit values with the first scaled relative to the other
        such that the sum forms a number of up to 32-bit precision.
    * - *pzeron*
      - PZEROn
      - Parameter scaling zero point
      - Float
      - extension
      - This keyword is reserved for use within the FITS Random Groups
        structure.  This keyword shall be used, along with the PSCALn keyword,
        when the nth FITS group parameter value is not the true physical
        value, to transform the group parameter value to the physical value. 
        The value field shall contain a floating point number, representing
        the true value corresponding to a group parameter value of zero.  The
        default value for this keyword is 0.0. The transformation equation is
        as follows: physical_value = PZEROn + PSCALn * group_parameter_value.
    * - *referenc*
      - REFERENC
      - Bibliographic reference
      - String
      - any
      - The value field shall contain a character string citing a reference
        where the data associated with the header are published.
    * - *simple*
      - SIMPLE
      - Indicates whether the file conforms to the standard
      - Boolean
      - primary
      - The SIMPLE keyword is required to be the first keyword in the primary
        header of all FITS files. The value field shall contain a logical
        constant with the value T if the file conforms to the standard.  This
        keyword is mandatory for the primary header and is not permitted in
        extension headers.  A value of F signifies that the file does not
        conform to this standard.
    * - *tbcoln*
      - TBCOLn
      - Beginning column number
      - Integer
      - extension
      - The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain an integer
        specifying the column in which field n starts in an ASCII TABLE
        extension.  For tables, The TBCOLn keywords must be present for all
        values n=1 ... TFIELDS, and for no other values of n.  The value
        contains an integer specifying the column in which field n starts. 
        The first column of a row is numbered 1.
    * - *tdimn*
      - TDIMn
      - Dimensionality of the array
      - String
      - extension
      - The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a character
        string describing how to interpret the contents of field n as a
        multidimensional array, providing the number of dimensions and the
        length along each axis.  The form of the value is not further
        specified by the Standard.  A proposed convention is described in
        Appendix B.2 of the FITS Standard in which the value string has the
        format '(l,m,n...)' where l, m, n,... are the dimensions of the array.
                The data are ordered such that the array index of the first dimension
        given (l) is the most rapidly varying and that of the last dimension
        given is the least rapidly varying.
    * - *tdispn*
      - TDISPn
      - Display format
      - String
      - extension
      - The value field of this indexed keyword shall contain a character
        string describing the format recommended for the display of the
        contents of field n.  If the table value has been scaled, the physical
        value shall be displayed.  All elements in a field shall be displayed
        with a single, repeated format. For purposes of display, each byte of
        bit (type X) and byte (type B) arrays is treated as an unsigned
        integer. Arrays of type A may be terminated with a zero byte.  Only
        the format codes in Table 8.6, discussed in section 8.3.4 of the FITS
        Standard, are permitted for encoding. The format codes must be
        specified in upper case.  If the Bw.m, Ow.m, and Zw.m formats are not
        readily available to the reader, the Iw.m display format may be used
        instead, and if the ENw.d and ESw.d formats are not available, Ew.d
        may be used.  The meaning of this keyword is not defined for fields of
        type P in the Standard but may be defined in conventions using such
        fields.
    * - *telescop*
      - TELESCOP
      - Name of telescope
      - String
      - any

        or 'BINTABLE' extension.  The TFORMn keywords must be present for all
        values n=1...TFIELDS, and for no other values of n.
    * - *theap*
      - THEAP
      - Offset to starting data heap address
      - Integer
      - extension
      - The value field of this keyword shall contain an integer providing the
        separation, in bytes, between the start of the main data table and the
        start of a supplemental data area called the heap.  The default value,
        which is also the minimum allowed value, shall be the product of the
        values of NAXIS1 and NAXIS2. This keyword shall not be used if the
        value of PCOUNT is zero.  A proposed application of this keyword is
        presented in Appendix B.1 of the FITS Standard.
    * - *tnulln*
      - TNULLn
      - Value used to indicate undefined table element
      - String
      - extension
      - In ASCII 'TABLE' extensions, the value field for this indexed keyword
        shall contain the character string that represents an undefined value
        for field n.  The string is implicitly blank filled to the width of
        the field. In binary 'BINTABLE' table extensions, the value field for
        this indexed keyword shall contain the integer that represents an
        undefined value for field n of data type B, I, or J.  The keyword may
        not be used in 'BINTABLE' extensions if field n is of any other data

        quantity.  The value field shall contain a floating point number
        representing the coefficient of the linear term in the equation,
        physical_value = TZEROn + TSCALn * field_value, which must be used to
        compute the true physical value of the field, or, in the case of the
        complex data types C and M, of the real part of the field with the
        imaginary part of the scaling factor set to zero.  The default value
        for this keyword is 1.0.  This keyword may not be used if the format

      - any
      - Provides the integration time in seconds.  Although not a standard
        use, EXPTIME is commonly used to calculate the flux of a source via: 
        Flux = ADU / EXPTIME.  It is advisable to respect this usage.  Under
        this definition, when multiple images are combined into one, EXPTIME
        is sometimes used with NCOMBINE to reflect the type of combining
        operation: if the images are summed then EXPTIME is the total open
        shutter integration, summed over all the sub-exposures, but with
        NCOMBINE=1.  If N subexposures are averaged together into 1, then
        EXPTIME is the average exposure time, and with NCOMBINE = N.  The
        purpose of defining NCOMBINE in this way is to facilitate the
        calculation of image statistics.

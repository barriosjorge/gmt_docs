Health and Supervision
----------------------

Reliability is one of the key design drivers for the SWCS. Several principles
have been used in the reference architecture to address this:

  * Fault detection and management is implemented as close as possible to the
    source.

  * When a component does not have enough information to take a corrective
    action then its supervisor is notified.

  * Every subsystem, not only Device Control Subsystems, has to include a
    supervisor that takes care of life-cycle and fault management of the
    Subsystem.

  * A general system supervisor takes care of the overall life-cycle and health
    status of the system.

  * Supervisors can implement alternative strategies when possible, to improve
    the fault tolerance of the system. For example, maintaining the wavefront
    error will require switching to degraded modes when some sensor becomes
    unavailable or when a communication glitch occurs.

  * All Components have to specify formally their fault cases by means of alarm
    event conditions.

  * All alarm events are sent to the alarm service so operators can be notified
    and events can be logged for further analysis.

  * Although the ISS is ultimately responsible for personal and equipment
    safety, software and control Components should attempt to prevent the
    occurrence of fault conditions.

  * The ISS is always interrogated about the status of the interlocks relative
    to any given Subsystem or Component.

  * All the components are required to sample relevant state variables using the
    telemetry service. Telemetry data are sent to the telemetry service so they
    can be monitored and correlated with other state variables of the system.
    Telemetry data are essential to diagnose any faulty behavior so the system
    can be improved.

  * The Logging Service allows the logging of significant event occurrences
    during the nominal operation of the system. Analyzing transcription logs
    helps understanding the behavior of the system and to detect any
    malfunction.

Each Subsystem Supervisor implements the following functions when applicable:

  * Subsystem integrity (e.g., collision avoidance)

  * Subsystem component configuration (e.g., components are configured in the
    right sequence and with the right configuration properties, look-up-tables,
    etc.)

  * Subsystem robustness (e.g., behavior in presence of non-nominal conditions,
    fault management and tolerance)

  * Subsystem life-cycle (e.g., startup and shutdown)

  * Subsystem embedded diagnosis

  * Subsystem modal transition for subsystems that have different modes of
    operation

  * Subsystem IO health

Modules: Subsystem, Packages, Components
----------------------------------------

The SWCS domains (TCS, OPS, OSRV) are each composed of software subsystem
modules. As illustrated in the bottom row of the :ref:`swcs-organization`
figure, each subsystem is then made up of components organized into packages
according to their affinity or relationships. The SWC reference architecture16
defines a guide for organizing subsystem components into a set of canonical
packages.  Examples of packages and their components are shown in Tables on
:ref:`table-control_packages` and :ref:`figure-core_components`.  Which packages
exist in which subsystem depends on the specific functionality (e.g., some
subsystems do not require special calibration components, or do not interface
with hardware devices). The tables below describe this pattern, split in two
categories:

  * :ref:`Control Packages <table-control_packages>` – These packages are included in
    subsystems that involve the control of optomechanical hardware Devices.

  * :ref:`Operation Support Packages <operation-support-packages>` – These
    Packages include software components necessary to support health monitoring,
    automation, and proper operation of a Subsystem. Diagnosis and calibration
    packages are emphasized early on in the design. This is an area that is
    often overlooked despite the fact that they may take a significant amount of
    development effort, especially in the case of complex adaptive optics
    control subsystems.

   M1 Control System Package and Components Excerpt

The Figure above shows an example of the component organization for the M1 Control
System. The structure of all the SWCS Subsystems has been analyzed and developed
following this pattern. As described above and later in Section 10.3.5.2, domain
engineering helps to identify sets of common components that are the elementary
building blocks of the SWCS subsystems.  The figure on :ref:`figure-core_components`
below shows those core component classes.  Each component is defined by a set of
:ref:`figure-component_features` whose definitions are detailed in Section 10.3.5.5 on
Core Framework. In fact, all SWCS modules, including subsystems, packages, and
components are fully specified by a text file containing their features, as
shown in Table 10-4. Section 10.5.2.3 explains the formal specification process
in more detail.

   Component Features

Each Component has been assigned to a class that defines its default behavior in
the corresponding specification file. :ref:`The following code-block excerpt
<BaseLinearAxisController>` shows an example of the specification file that
defines the interface and features of a BaseLinearAxisController (Section
10.3.5.5.3 provides an overview of common motion control Components). This
specification is based on the IEC 61800-7-20117 Standard. The standard is
concrete, but at the same time is designed to cover a majority of the motion
control use cases. The design process captures when a Component (e.g.,
agws_radial_stage_ctrl) fits this default behavior. This approach provides
several benefits:

  * The specification of the component captures performance data, interfaces,
    etc., all of which are used directly in the final implementation.
    Furthermore, the specification closely dovetails a well-developed and
    industrial standard, which significantly reduces the effort needed to
    capture all the information.  This is in sync with the way industrial
    companies specify their subsystems.  This often allows one to implement the
    controller in a standard off-the-shelf smart drive, relieving the computing
    platform of the responsibility to perform all the real-time functionality.
    As the control loops run in dedicated standardized controllers, it is then
    feasible to implement a layer that integrates the controller with the rest
    of the observatory services using more productive high-level languages
    (Section 10.4.6).

  * The mapping between specification and implementation is as direct as it
    gets, and greatly facilitates the traceability of requirements.

  * The interfaces of similar Components share the same detailed specification
    (e.g., the interfaces of all the linear stages are the same). This not only
    allows the development of common control Components, but the possibility to
    reuse common visualization or calibration Components, as well as testing
    procedures.

  * It is possible to specify accordingly the majority of the elementary degrees
    of freedom of the GMT as well as some Axis Groups (e.g.,
    BaseLinearXYController for a Cartesian linear stage), as discussed in
    Section 10.3.2. It is also possible to incorporate fault management, and
    startup/shut down procedures in the same manner modeled using supervisor
    components.  Supervisors are usually more specific to the application and
    their implementation, thus require more customization. Other domains, like
    user interface components or data processing components have been subject to
    the same design process. Sections 10.3.5.9 and Section 10.3.5.7 describe
    them respectively.

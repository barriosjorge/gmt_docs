*System Supervisor Service*
............................

Health and quality monitoring is central to ensuring that all the hardware,
devices, components, and so on down the line are working properly and safely.
As such, means of monitoring are provided inside many hardware and their
devices at all levels via controller supervisors (which are defined as part of
the SWCS architecture).

The GMT has a large number of distributed Subsystems and Components that are
deployed in different computers or embedded units to implement telescope
control functions. Each Subsystem is required to deploy a Supervisor to
coordinate, monitor, and manage, the health status of its respective software
and hardware Components. In order to guarantee reliability it is important to
monitor and manage the overall health of these Subsystems and Components. The
System Supervisor is thus in charge of the overall health of the system by
watching over the hierarchy. It ensures that the system as a whole can handle
fault tolerance, service availability, and failure detection, thus ensuring
the overall robustness.

The implementation of supervisory functions in a dedicated subsystem allows
the rest of the components to focus on their primary operational functions. It
allows the separation of responsibilities, thus enabling the supervisory
strategies to evolve independently from their subsystems. For example, it is
possible to implement a new supervisory strategy without the need to modify
the application subsystems. This strategy also simplifies the implementation
of the Supervisory Service, as it only has to focus on monitoring and managing
the health of the system. A mix of watchdog, heartbeat, and ping, mechanisms
usually accomplishes this.

The System Supervisor accesses the database to load runtime system
configurations appropriate to a given operation mode (e.g., only the health of
focal stations that are considered active or standby or the hardware installed
on the telescope, FSM vs. ASM, are being monitored).

  System Supervisor Service Block Diagram.   (1) A component creates a
  *health* event and invokes the *health_check* method inherited from the
  *BaseComponent* or *BaseSupervisor* classes. (2) A service adapter sends the
  *health* event to the supervisor using a push socket. (3) The service
  supervisor forwards the event to the subscribed components using a pub
  socket.

The above System Supervisor design is inspired by `Erlang/OTP
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)>`_ which is one of
the most reliable systems. It is designed to recover easily from fault
conditions. The emphasis in Erlang is not so much to reduce the risk of
failure, but to consider fault conditions as part of the nominal scenario so
as to be able to recover from faults quickly and efficiently.

**Service Capabilities**

  The System Supervisor provides the following capabilities:

    * Coordinates the GMT automatic start-up and shutdown procedures

    * Starts and shuts down the subsystem hardware

    * Re-starts any SWC subsystem that crashes

    * Re-starts any SWC subsystem when requested by a user

    * Ensures that all the subsystems required by a given operation mode are in
      nominal operation state (e.g., ping/watchdog)

    * Enables users to query the health of all subsystems at various
      granularities. Querying may be performed via user interfaces at high levels,
      and direct command line interfaces at low levels. The query system will
      allow users to learn about devices, commands, and meaning of the parameters
      and outputs, on-line and interactively.

    * Manages optimal information flow to inform human supervisors. This
      involves processing and filtering of information.

    * Provides effective and efficient visualization displays that adequately
      capture the overall health of the observatory, telescope, instruments, and
      weather environment.

    * Reports host information: Operating system resources usage, version of
      operating system and installed software, version of every software module,
      validation vs. specified configuration.

    * Enables automated localization and alert of problems and devices that do
      not operate within nominal ranges, or environmental conditions that endanger
      the safety of the telescope or observatory.

    * Reports information about the processes running in the system: start time,
      status, etc.

    * Administers the system deployment model

    * Redeploys a service or process in an alternative computer if the one
      assigned becomes unresponsive.

    * Implements secondary fault tolerance and load balancing. (The system
      supervisor, analyses the load of the different services and may deploy
      additional resources to address additional demands)

    * Detects health of the underlying communication infrastructure

    * Implements an Observatory Wide rule system to match global rule conditions
      and trigger associated actions.

    * Acts as a Supervisor of supervisors. Each subsystem is required to deploy
      a Subsystem supervisor.

**Service Packages**

  The System Supervisor Subsystem is organized in the following configuration:

    System Supervisor Product Tree

  *Service Package (server & adapter)* -

    A supervisory server system, deployed in several machines, takes care of
    implementing the System Supervisory functions. Additionally the system
    supervisor server provides features that allow managing of load balancing
    and fault tolerance. The system supervisor operation, as with any other
    component, can be monitored by the telemetry system defining monitoring
    features in its interface (e.g., the number of components connected,
    number of active alarms, state of the server, instant alarm throughput).

  *Analytics Package* -

    The analytics package provides the following capabilities:

      * Allows reconstructing the history of the health of the system.
      * Allows the analysis package components to run in real time streaming mode.
      * Triggers any action associated with the system supervisor rules.

  *Visualization Package* -

    The visualization package provides custom panels that allow observatory
    operators to monitor and manage the System Supervision System, summarized
    in the following table:

**Service Deployment**

  The System Supervisor service is a distributed system; it consists of
  several components running on different computers in the GMT control
  network. A System Supervisor server is deployed in one of the Sever Class
  Computers in the electronics room. Each SWCS subsystem is required to deploy
  a Subsystem Supervisor Component in the corresponding computer. It is
  important to emphasize that all of the SWCS subsystems are required to
  deploy a supervisor, this includes not only Device control Subsystems but
  also user interface applications.

  The visualization package components are deployed in the control room
  Operation Support Computers.

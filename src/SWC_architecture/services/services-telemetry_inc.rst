*Telemetry Service*
...................

  The telemetry service provides the ability to observe any data transmitted by
  hardware or software subsystem available for monitoring. Telemetry data
  usually consist of a continuous flow of scalar values at a certain rate. The
  Telemetry Service allows one to select the quantities to monitor, and to start
  or to stop collecting data.

  The telemetry adapter provides an interface that allows:

    * Retrieval of quantities to be monitored in a given Subsystem or Component

    * Start/stop sampling and collecting of monitoring data

    * Specifying the rate at which the data are sampled.

  Two categories of measurement data can be sampled:

    * Continuous: quantities that are continuous in values. For instance, a
      temperature sensor. 

    * Discrete: quantities that are discrete in values. For instance, the state
      of a switch (ON, OFF), the position of a window within a range of three
      possible positions (CLOSED, HALF-OPEN, OPEN), etc. When monitoring
      discrete quantities, only the changes of value are sampled.

  The Table below shows the GMT estimated bandwidth including all subsystems
  described in Table 10-5 plus AO. The total average bandwidth is 76.35 MBps, or
  2.62 TB per night (considering a 10hr night), which defines the GMT storage
  requirements.

  The telemetry service is implemented, like other infrastructure services, as a
  distributed system.  The telemetry adapters allow any component of the system,
  usually running in Device Control Computers, to send any telemetry data to the
  telemetry supervisor through a common API.  Depending on the required
  bandwidth the adapter may provide different transport strategies (e.g., a
  circular buffer held in memory or Solid State Disk that is flushed
  periodically) and fault tolerance capabilities (e.g., routing the outgoing
  data to an alternative supervisor). The telemetry supervisor takes care of
  storing the data in the telemetry database for further analysis or to relay
  the streams of data for presentation in the user interface.

  **Service Packages**

    *Service Package (server & adapter)* - 

      A telemetry server system, deployed eventually in several machines takes
      care of receiving telemetry samples, storing them and forwarding them to
      the telemetry user interface panels or the telemetry analysis system.

      In addition to the handling of telemetry monitors, the telemetry server
      provides features that allow load balancing and fault tolerance. The
      telemetry system operation, as with any other component, can be monitored
      by the telemetry system itself specifying monitor features in its
      interface (e.g., number of components connected, number of active alarms,
      state of the server, instant alarm throughput).

    *Analytics Package* -

      The analytics package provides the following capabilities:

        * History reconstruction of any quantity monitored by the system
        * Real-time monitoring and telemetry analysis in streaming mode.
        * Export of time-stamped telemetry data samples to ASCII format (e.g., CSV files).

    *Visualization Package* -

      The visualization package provides custom panels that allow observatory
      operators to monitor and manage the telemetry of the system. This is done
      by implementing several optimized visualizations.

  **Service Deployment**

    The most demanding use of the telemetry system will be for AO operations; a
    potential implementation is shown in the Figure below. Sampling the dense
    actuator subsystems at full rates and storing the data for follow-up
    analysis and diagnosis require large storage capacity, large bandwidth, and
    the ability to access the data efficiently.

    The :ref:`telemetry bandwidth estimate <telemetry_bandwidth>` table above
    presents the bandwidth requirements for telemetry service in the AO
    observing modes. The aggregated bandwidth required is just 260 MB/s due to
    the fact that it is not necessary to store the WFS pixel values. For
    follow-up diagnostic purposes, the AO System requirements document
    stipulates that the full rate telemetry should be stored for a minimum
    period of 10 min, with the goal of storing a full night of telemetry data.

    With the current generation, low cost, Infiniband network adapters and
    switches, bandwidth tests (see :ref:`Networking Section <networking>`) show
    that it is already possible to achieve an average of 3 GB/s. Readily
    available Solid State Drives (SSD) provide a data writing bandwidth in
    excess of 1 GB/s using a PCIExpress 3.0 interface, and more if they are
    combined in a RAID arrangement. Only 16 GB are necessary to hold 10 minutes
    of telemetry at full rate, a trivial amount now for current high-end solid
    state drives. As performance inevitably improves and the storage cost
    continues to decrease with time, storing a full night of telemetry data in a
    cost-effective way will be achievable.

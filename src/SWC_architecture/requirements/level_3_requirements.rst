Level 3 SWCS Requirements
-------------------------

The Level 3 SWCS Requirements Document [Mait13]_ is broadly divided into
Functional & Performance Requirements, and General Requirements, as prescribed
by Systems Engineering. Functional & Performance Requirements address telescope
operations (e.g., pointing, guiding, calibration, and thermal control),
observations, and observatory operations (e.g., data management, networking, and
common services).  In comparison, General Requirements address standards,
environment, health and safety, power services, maintenance, reliability, and
documentation of the observatory systems.

Before delving more specifically into Level 3 SWCS requirements, the following
Table presents an overview of the key System Level Requirements and their
flow-down to the SWCS:

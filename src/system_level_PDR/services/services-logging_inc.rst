*Logging Service*
.................

  Logging records the history of events, whether normal or abnormal, surrounding
  GMT operations, such as whether an user has logged on to the GMT, or an
  observation has just been completed. Logging events are intended for view and
  access on a console, and stored in a persistent database.

  The *analysis package* provides the capability to visualize or display
  specific information in the log database, e.g., automatically generate
  periodic reports reflecting operator activity, command logs, instrument and
  equipment activity.  Messages generated during an observation can be added to
  the observation data bundle to enable provenance and quality monitoring.
  Sometimes major errors can arise first from scattered and seemingly harmless
  errors that are correlated in time. The supervisor service can define rules to
  detect and decide whether such occurrences are symptomatic of something more
  severe.

  The following illustrates a log event specification:

  The figure below illustrates the Logging Service and the interactions between
  the components involved in the creation and propagation of log events.
  Adapters forward the log events to the log supervisor using push/pull sockets.
  Usually a single Log Adapter is deployed for all the components of a Subsystem
  that are collocated in the same computer. Although the interfaces are
  different this arrangement is similar to the design other services.

    Logging Service Block Diagram.  (1) A Component creates a log message and
    invokes the *log* method inherited from the *BaseComponent* or
    *BaseSupervisor* classes.  (2)  The Service Adapters forward the log events
    to the log supervisor using push/pull sockets. Usually a single Log Adapter
    is deployed for all the components of a Subsystem that are collocated in the
    same computer. Although the interfaces are different this arrangement is
    similar to the design other services. (3) The Service Supervisor forwards
    the event to the subscribed components using a pub socket.

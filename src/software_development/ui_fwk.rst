UI Framework
============

.. note::
    The UI framework is currently only supported on MacOS.  Linux support will be available in future releases.

The UI Framework introduces a set of libraries and a windowed application that provides a GUI for the OCS.  The framework handles three primary concerns

* Rendering (drawing) elements to the screen (DOM) 
* Library of re-usable UI components that can be shared across the project
* An Engineering App that provides an interface to the OCS

Installation
------------

Download the UI library files

* http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/releases/navigator/ocs_navigator_lib_1.6.0.zip

Move the contents of the zip to ``$GMT_LOCAL/lib/js``

Download the Mac App

* http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/releases/navigator/mac/ocs_navigator_app_1.6.0.zip

You can unzip the app anywhere on your MacOS file system.  Double click on the icon to run.

Engineering App
---------------

The engineering application provides a GUI to the OCS model.  It is a downloadble Mac app that you can run after installing the SDK on your Mac.

The UI engineering app uses your local bundles from ``$GMT_LOCAL/etc/bundles`` and allows you to see a visual representation of your model files' input/output ports.  For now, the Engineering app runs in MacOS. 

To launch the application, double click on the app icon.

Configuration
-------------

The User Interface needs to be configured to connect to the correct control components to receive data. Without proper configuration, the application may look like this:

.. image:: navigator_images/Navigator_HDK_noconnection.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Navigator application - No connection to HDK components

Edit the appropriate config files in the ``src/etc/conf`` folder to point to the correct IP address for input and output ports. For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL/modules/ocs_hdk_dcs/src/etc/conf/hdk_ctrl_pkg/hdk_main_ctrl/
    $ sed -i '' "s/127.0.0.1/172.16.10.31/g" hdk_main_ctrl_config.coffee

See the Troubleshooting section below for more help with connection issues.

Restart the Navigator application for changes to take affect.

User Guide
----------

.. image:: navigator_images/Navigator_slices.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Navigator application regions

The navigator application contains two regions.

1. **Navigation** This area contains the navigation tree.  The tree is a representation of your model and is built from information found in your local bundles.
2. **Context** Items selected in the tree will display here.  Currently, it will display a representation of your model's input/output ports and state variables.  

.. note::
    The **Context** area will optimistically render your model.  Not all model data can be currently rendered. Some items like `properties` and detailed port views are currently not supported.

Launching Custom Panels
-----------------------

From the menu, select ``Vis package`` and select ``Panel loader``.  This will launch a panel allowing you to select a custom vis package. 


Troubleshooting Guide
---------------------

The engineering app loads the local bundles defined in ``$GMT_LOCAL/etc/bundles``.  It currently uses the model generated config files to read data for your package.  Those config files are created in ``$GMT_LOCAL/modules/<your_module>/src/etc/conf/<your_package>_pkg/<component>_config.coffee``; it's useful to see what's in those configs when troubleshooting data availability issues.  The availability of data to the UI largely depends on those config files.  The values generated will depend on how you write your model, but a sample of a config file might look like 

    .. code-block:: coffee

        module.exports =
            properties:
                uri: { name: 'uri', default_value: 'gmt://hdk_dcs/hdk_main_ctrl/hdk_main_ctrl' , type: 'String', desc: 'Uri path for the component' }
                # other fields ommited

            state_vars:
                hmi: { name: 'hmi',   }
                motor: { name: 'motor',   }

            input_ports:
                hmi_goal:            { name: 'hmi_goal',              protocol: 'pull',  url: 'tcp://127.0.0.1:8116', blocking_mode: 'async', max_rate: 1000,  nom_rate: 1     }
                motor_goal:          { name: 'motor_goal',            protocol: 'pull',  url: 'tcp://172.16.10.31:8117', blocking_mode: 'async', max_rate: 1000,  nom_rate: 1     }

            output_ports:
                hmi_value:           { name: 'hmi_value',             protocol: 'pub',   url: 'tcp://127.0.0.1:8122', blocking_mode: 'async', max_rate: 1000,  nom_rate: 1     }
                motor_value:         { name: 'motor_value',           protocol: 'pub',   url: 'tcp://172.16.10.31:8123', blocking_mode: 'async', max_rate: 1000,  nom_rate: 1     }


When troubleshooting it's important to note the `protocol` and the `url` keys for a given port.  For example the ``hmi_value.url`` value is ``tcp://127.0.0.1:8122`` this means you're trying to connect to port number ``8122`` on the address ``127.0.0.1`` (which is typically your local machine).  Whereas the ``motor_value.url`` is trying to connect to a different computer with an IP address ``172.16.10.31`` on port number ``8123``. 

If the computer at ``172.16.10.31`` is firewalled and not allowing connections to port ``8123``, you will not be able to see data.  You will need to allow incoming connections to that port.  Likewise, if your component is running at the computer at ``172.16.10.31`` and you are trying to read data from ``127.0.0.1``, you will not see any data.  You will need to change the IP to match the computer where your component is running.

Additionally, the UI can only read data from ports configured with the ``pub`` protocol.

If you make changes to the config file, you will need to restart the command line app; you can do this by pressing ``CTRL + C``.

* **Incorrect NODE_MODULE_VERSION**: In some cases, the ``$GMT_GLOBAL/node_modules`` will take precedent over the ones used by the App.  In this case, rename the ``$GMT_GLOBAL/node_modules`` to something like ``$GMT_GLOBAL/node_modules.bak``.
* **Unresponsive UI**: in some case if the UI becomes unresponsive, press ``CMD+R`` to refresh.  If that fails to solve the problem, restart the CLI app.  You can stop the CLI app with ``CTRL+C``.
* **No navigation tree**: the navigation tree is rendered off the local bundles in ``$GMT_LOCAL\etc\bundles``.  The bundles described there need to have been built with webpack.
* **No data**: Ensure that the ports used by the controllers to publish data are accessible through the firewall. The following command should be used on the Device Control Computer to open the applicable range of ports (8122 - 8124):

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8122-8124/tcp

Installing the SDK
==================

Development Platform
--------------------

The development platform is no longer distributed as a standalone ISO file. Instead, the following guide is provided to assist with hardware, operating system and third-party software configuration required for running the OCS SDK. Some key areas, such as disk partitioning, user authentication and NFS mounting of home directories, depending on individual factors at each partner institution and should, therefore, be considered examples only.

Benefits of this approach, versus distributing the complete ISO, include the ability to support different network, hardware and software platforms used for software development by different partner institutions, as well as allowing for separate upgrade schedules for the Development Platform and Software Development Kit without affecting ongoing subsystem software development.

.. note::

   At GMTO, these instructions are formalized using Kickstart files and installed via the network using tools such as Cobbler. The GMTO DevOps team can provide assistance in setting up a similar system for development at partner institutions if required.

The Observatory Control System (OCS) is designed to be a distributed system with device control components running on real-time computers, connected to common services and user interface components via the control network.

For device control systems, the following operating systems are supported:
    - CentOS 8

For user interfaces, the following operating systems are supported:
    - MacOS
    - CentOS 8

Server Configuration
--------------------

Servers are used for developing, running and testing device control software and core services. When real-time communication with hardware is required, the real-time kernel should be installed and configured. The following guidelines for creating a server should be tailored according to its intended purpose.

Required Hardware
.................

Minimum hardware requirements for development machines:

  * Intel Pentium 4 or higher, 2 GHz CPU
  * 1 GB Memory
  * 20 GB Hard drive

Typical GMT OCS development machine specs:

  * Intel Xeon E3 or higher, 3.2 GHz CPU
  * 4 - 8 GB Memory
  * 120 - 250 GB Hard drive


.. _Operating system:
Operating System
................

1. Install the Centos 8 Operating System. A `minimal` server installation is sufficient for the use of the GMT SDK.
   Change the filesystem of the partitions to ext4 if using the real-time kernel.

.. warning::
  If you plan to develop real-time components, the Linux kernel requires the root partition to be an **ext4** file system. Please ensure that this is configured correctly in the disk partitioning settings.

.. warning::
  Due to a `bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1812120>`_, openssh-server should temporarily not be
  upgraded to any version greater than 8.0p1-3.el8. To fix the openssh-server version, run this command right after the
  Operating System installation:


  .. code-block:: bash
    $ sudo echo "exclude=openssh* libssh*" >> /etc/dnf/dnf.conf

2. Disable firewall

  .. code-block:: bash
    systemctl disable firewalld
    systemctl stop firewalld

3. Disable SELinux
  .. code-block:: bash
    sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config
    setenforce 0

.. warning::
  Make sure an external firewall protects your server


Repository Configuration
........................

Some required RPMs are built by GMTO and need to be downloaded from the GMTO Yum Repository, currently hosted on Amazon Web Services.

To add the GMT repositories:

1. Add the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/gmt.repo`` with the following content:

  .. code-block:: bash

    [gmt]
    name=GMT $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/yum/stable/$releasever/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1

2. Add the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/gmt-updates.repo`` with the following content:

  .. code-block:: bash

    [gmt-updates]
    name=GMT $releasever - $basearch - Updates
    baseurl=http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/yum/updates/$releasever/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1

MongoDB Configuration
.....................

1. Add the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-4.repo`` with the following content:

  .. code-block:: bash

     [mongodb-org-4]
     name=MongoDB Repository
     baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/7/mongodb-org/4.2/x86_64/
     gpgcheck=1
     enabled=1
     gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc

2. Install the necessary packages:

    $ sudo dnf -y install mongodb-org

3. Create the database files directory

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir -p /data/db

4. Enable the MongoDB service

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl enable mongod
    $ sudo systemctl start mongod

5. Check that the MongoDB service is up

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl status -l mongod


EtherCAT Configuration
......................

EtherCAT is a high-speed Fieldbus communication system used for real-time control. The following configuration steps should be used as a guide when configuring EtherCAT communications.

1. Install the real-time kernel and relevant packages

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf install -y --nogpgcheck kernel-3.14.73-rt78.x86_64 ethercat-devel

.. warning::
  Before installing the RT kernel, check restrictions on :ref:`Operating System` warnings.


2. Select the Ethernet interface to be used for EtherCAT communication (e.g. enp4s0) and edit the corresponding configuration file (e.g. ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp4s0``) to set the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=no

3. Check the Hardware Address (MAC) of the selected EtherCAT network interface

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ ifconfig

4. Edit ``/etc/ethercat.conf`` and set the following configuration options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    MASTER0_DEVICE="<mac_address_1>"
    MASTER0_BACKUP="<mac_address_2>"  # optional line

  Where ``<mac_address_1>`` and ``<mac_address_2>`` are the two hardware addresses associated with the Ethercat network interface communicating with the Ethercat ring (redundant topology). If you prefer using a linear topology (non-redundant), comment or remove the second line (``MASTER0_BACKUP="<mac_address_2>"``).

5. Edit ``/usr/lib/systemd/system/ethercat.service`` and uncomment the following line:

  .. code-block:: bash

    Before=network.service

6. Reboot into the RT Kernel, if you're not in it already.

7. Enable the Ethercat service

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl enable ethercat
    $ sudo systemctl start ethercat

8. Edit ``/etc/security/limits.d/99-realtime.conf`` and add the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    @realtime - rtprio 99
    @realtime - memlock unlimited

9. Add a new group and add the "gmto" user to it.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo groupadd -f -g 2001 realtime
    $ sudo usermod --groups realtime gmto

8. Test the Ethercat configuration

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ ethercat master
    $ ethercat slaves

If the ``ethercat master`` command does not produce the correct output, ensure that you're currently running the real-time kernel. If the ``ethercat slaves`` command produces no output, check that the ethernet cable is connected to the correct port as configured above.


Network Time Protocol Configuration
...................................

For general network timekeeping, use NTP, unless Precision Time Protocol is required.

1. Install the necessary packages:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf install -y chrony

2. Enable the NTP Service

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl enable chronyd

3. Check date/time servers

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo chronyc sources


Software Development Kit (SDK)
------------------------------

The Software Development Kit is distributed as a TAR file and can be downloaded from the GMTO release server.

The SDK should be installed in a **Global GMT Software Location**, defined by the GMT_GLOBAL environment variable (default value: /opt/gmt). A **Local Working Directory**, defined by the GMT_LOCAL variable, is used as a unique workspace for individual developers. The local working directory typically resides underneath the /home/<username> directory.

1. Download the latest SDK distribution:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ wget http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/releases/sdk/linux/gmt-sdk.tar.gz

2. Extract the TAR file in the /opt directory, into a new folder for the latest release:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir /opt/gmt_release_1.8.0
    $ sudo tar -xzvf gmt-sdk.tar.gz -C /opt/gmt_release_1.8.0

  where gmt-sdk.tar.gz is the file downloaded in step 1.

3. Create a symbolic link from the **Global GMT Software Location** to the latest release:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo ln -sfn /opt/gmt_release_1.8.0 /opt/gmt

4. Create a **Local Working Directory**

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir <local_working_dir>

  where ``<local_working_dir>`` is in the current users' home directory, for example, ~/work. The GMT software modules developed by the user are created in this folder.

5. Add the following lines to your .bash_profile (or .kshrc or .bashrc depending on your preferred shell)

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ export GMT_GLOBAL=/opt/gmt
    $ export GMT_LOCAL=<local_working_dir>
    $ source $GMT_GLOBAL/bin/gmt_env.sh

  This will ensure that the environment variables are correctly configured when opening a new terminal. Please log out and back in for the changes to take effect. To configure the environment for the current shell, run the commands manually.

6. Check the values of the environment variables:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ gmt_env

7. Install Node Modules

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_GLOBAL
    $ sudo npm install

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL
    $ cp $GMT_GLOBAL/package.json ./
    $ npm install

8. Initialize the Development Environment:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL
    $ gds init

  The correct folders will be created in the $GMT_LOCAL directory for use when compiling and running modules.

9. Create a **modules** directory in $GMT_LOCAL

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL
    $ mkdir modules

10. Create the **bundles.coffee** and **ocs_local_bundle.coffee** files, defining the local modules under development

  These files may be copied from $GMT_GLOBAL and then edited to reflect the developer's configuration.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir $GMT_LOCAL/etc/bundles
    $ cp $GMT_GLOBAL/etc/bundles/bundles.coffee $GMT_LOCAL/etc/bundles/
    $ cp $GMT_GLOBAL/etc/bundles/ocs_local_bundle.coffee $GMT_LOCAL/etc/bundles/

  Edit **bundles.coffee** to point to the ocs_local_bundle.coffee file

  .. code-block:: bash

    module.exports =
        ocs_local_bundle:   {scope: "local",  desc: "GMT iSample and HDK bundle"}

  Edit **ocs_local_bundle.coffee** to include the ISample and HDK modules, or other modules that you are working on

  .. code-block:: bash

     module.exports =
     name:      "local"
     desc:      "List of local development modules"
     elements:
         isample_dcs: { active: true, test: false, developer: 'gmto', domain: 'idcs' }
         hdk_dcs:     { active: true, test: false, developer: 'gmto', domain: 'idcs' }

11. Build all model files from modules in your ocs_local_bundles definition using webpack. For example:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL/modules/ocs_hdk_dcs/model
    $ webpack
    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL/modules/ocs_isample_dcs/model
    $ webpack

Installing the SDK
==================

Required Hardware
-----------------

Minimum hardware requirements for development machines:

  * Intel Pentium 4 or higher, 2 GHz CPU
  * 1 GB Memory
  * 20 GB Hard drive

Typical GMT OCS development machine specs:

  * Intel Xeon E3 or higher, 3.2 GHz CPU
  * 4 - 8 GB Memory
  * 120 - 250 GB Hard drive

Development Platform
--------------------

The development platform is no longer distributed as a standalone ISO file. Instead, the following guide is provided to assist with hardware, operating system and third-party software configuration required for running the OCS SDK. Some key areas, such as disk partitioning, user authentication and NFS mounting of home directories, depend on individual factors at each partner institution and should therefore be considered examples only.

Benefits of this approach versus distributing the complete ISO include the ability to support different network, hardware and software platforms used for software development by different partner institutions, as well as allowing for separate upgrade schedules for the Development Platform and Software Development Kit without affecting ongoing subsystem software development.

.. note::

   At GMTO, these instructions are formalized using Kickstart files and installed via the network using tools such as Cobbler. The GMTO DevOps team can provide assistance in setting up a similar system for development at partner institutions, if required.


Operating System
................

The SDK is currently configured to run on the **Fedora 26 Server** Linux Operating System.

  1. The ISO file can be downloaded from the Fedora website: https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/26/Server/x86_64/iso/. 

    Alternatively, download the file directly from the terminal:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ curl -O https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/26/Server/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-26-1.5.iso

  2. Install the operating system on the development machine by either creating a bootable USB drive or via network installation using tools such as Cobbler and Kickstart. Other options include running Fedora 26 in a Virtual Machine or Docker Containers, however, the use of virtualization and its impact on connecting to actual hardware has not been fully tested.

       dev_environment/boot_installation
       dev_environment/anaconda_install

.. note::

  Future versions of the SDK could include support for CentOS, RHEL, Scientific Linux and/or MacOS. Fedora has a very short release and support cycle (6 months and 18 months respectively), which is not ideal for a platform that requires significant stability over long periods of time.

Repository Configuration
........................

Some required RPMs are built by GMTO and need to be downloaded from the GMTO Yum Repository, currently hosted on Amazon Web Services. 

To add the GMT repositories:

1. Add the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/gmt.repo`` with the following content:

  .. code-block:: bash

    [gmt]
    name=GMT $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/yum/stable/$releasever/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1

2. Add the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/gmt-updates.repo`` with the following content:

  .. code-block:: bash

    [gmt-updates]
    name=GMT $releasever - $basearch - Updates
    baseurl=http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/yum/updates/$releasever/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1

Advanced System Configuration
.............................

In a distributed computing environment, used by multiple developers, it is very convenient to use a centralized LDAP server for User Authentication and automatically mount /home directories from a network drive. The LDAP and NFS server configuration is network-dependent. The following instructions can be used as guidelines when configuring individual development machines to make use these services, if available.

  .. note::

    This configuration is currently optional. The alternative is to add users manually and manage permissions locally on each development machine.

1. Install the real-time kernel and relevant packages

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ dnf install -y --nogpgcheck kernel-3.14.73-rt78.x86_64 ethercat-devel

2. Select the Ethernet interface to be used for EtherCAT communication (e.g. enp4s0) and edit the corresponding configuration file (e.g. ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp4s0``) to set the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=no

3. Check the Hardware Address of the selected EtherCAT network interface

  .. code-block:: bash
    
    $ ifconfig

4. Edit ``/etc/ethercat.conf`` and set the following configuration option:

  .. code-block:: bash

    MASTER0_DEVICE="<mac_address>"

  where ``<mac_address>`` is the hardware address associated with the Ethercat network interface.

    verbose         1
    time_stamping   software
    summary_interval 6
    [enp3s0]

where ``[enp3s0]`` should be set to the interface to use for PTP.

3. Edit ``/etc/sysconfig/phc2sys`` and add the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    OPTIONS="-a -r -u 60"

4. Edit ``/etc/sysconfig/ptp4l`` and add the following options:

6. Enable the ptp service

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ systemctl enable ptp4l


Software Development Kit (SDK)
------------------------------

The Software Development Kit is distributed as a TAR file and can be downloaded from the GMTO release server. 

The SDK should be installed in a **Global GMT Software Location**, defined by the GMT_GLOBAL environment variable (default value: /opt/gmt). A **Local Working Directory**, unique for each individual developer (GMT_LOCAL). The local working directory typically resides underneath the /home/<username> directory.

1. Create the **Global GMT Software Location**:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir /opt/gmt

2. Download the latest SDK distribution and install in the **Global GMT Software Location**:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ wget -P /opt/gmt http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/releases/sdk/linux/gmt-sdk-1.4-0.tar.gz
    $ cd /opt/gmt
    $ sudo tar -xvzf gmt-sdk-1.4.0.tar.gz

3. Create a **Local Working Directory**

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir <local_working_dir>

where ``<local_working_dir>`` is in the current users' home directory, typically /home/<username>/<path_to_working_dir>. The GMT software modules developed by the user are created in this folder.

4. Add the following lines to your .profile (or .kshrc or .bashrc depending on your preferred shell)

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ export GMT_GLOBAL=/opt/gmt
    $ export GMT_LOCAL=<local_working_dir>
    $ source $GMT_GLOBAL/bin/gmt_env.sh

This will ensure that the environment variables are correctly configured when opening a new terminal. Please log out and back in for the changes to take effect. To configure the environment for the current shell, run the commands manually.

5. Check the values of the environment variables:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ gmt_env

6. Initialize the Development Environment:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL
    $ gds init

The correct folders will be created in the $GMT_LOCAL directory for use when compiling and running modules.
